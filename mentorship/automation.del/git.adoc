== SSH Key Generation

To generate and add an SSH key for GitHub on a Windows machine, follow these steps:

1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**:
- Open Git Bash and run:
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
- If you see files like `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have an SSH key.

2. **Generate a New SSH Key**:
- In Git Bash, enter the following command (replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email):
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- If your system doesn’t support `ed25519`, use:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

3. **Save the SSH Key**:
- You’ll be prompted to save the key. Press `Enter` to accept the default location (`/c/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

4. **Set a Passphrase**:
- Optionally, you can enter a passphrase for added security or just press `Enter` for no passphrase.

5. **Add SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:
- Start the SSH agent:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
- Add your SSH key:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

6. **Copy the SSH Key to Your Clipboard**:
- Use this command to copy your SSH key:
```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
- If you used RSA, the command would be:
```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

7. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**:
- Go to your GitHub account [SSH and GPG keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
- Click on **New SSH key**, give it a title, and paste your key in the "Key" field.

8. **Test Your SSH Connection**:
- Run the following command to test your connection:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
- If successful, you should see a message like:
```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

You’re now ready to use SSH with GitHub on Windows!
