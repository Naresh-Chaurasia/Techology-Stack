== Intended Outcome of the Course

Upon completing this course, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of Spring Boot and microservices architecture. They will be proficient in designing, developing, and deploying scalable microservices using Spring Boot and related Spring Cloud technologies. Participants will:

* Build RESTful APIs and microservices from scratch, incorporating best practices for modular and maintainable code.
* Develop and secure microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JWT for authentication and authorization.
* Implement service discovery, centralized configuration, load balancing, and API gateway patterns to enhance microservice communication and resilience.
* Containerize microservices using Docker and manage deployments using Kubernetes for scalable and fault-tolerant systems.
* Gain hands-on experience with monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing for production-ready microservices.
* Work on a capstone project that integrates the learned concepts into a real-world e-commerce application, reinforcing both technical skills and project-based learning.

By the end of the course, participants will be equipped to design and implement robust microservice solutions and will have the confidence to apply these skills in enterprise-level projects.
