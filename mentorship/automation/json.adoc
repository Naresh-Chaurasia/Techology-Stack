== JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
It's commonly used for transmitting data in web applications between a server and a client.

*Key Features of JSON:*

* Data is represented in key-value pairs.
* Uses simple syntax with minimal formatting (e.g., no comments).
* Commonly used with APIs for exchanging data.

*JSON Syntax:*

* JSON objects are enclosed in `{ }`.
* Data is written in key-value pairs, separated by a colon `:`.
* Arrays are enclosed in `[ ]`.

*Student JSON Example:*

```json
{
    "studentId": "S12345",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 21,
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Elm Street",
        "city": "Springfield",
        "state": "IL",
        "postalCode": "62704"
    },
    "courses": [
        {
            "courseId": "CSE101",
            "courseName": "Introduction to Computer Science",
            "credits": 4
        },
        {
            "courseId": "MTH201",
            "courseName": "Calculus I",
            "credits": 3
        }
    ],
    "isEnrolled": true
}
```

*Explanation:*

* The `address` is a nested JSON object containing details about the student's residence.
* The `courses` field is an array containing multiple JSON objects, each representing a course the student is enrolled in.
* The `isEnrolled` key is a boolean indicating the enrollment status of the student.

*Accessing JSON Elements:*

1. **Accessing the `firstName`:**

```javascript
let firstName = student.firstName;
console.log(firstName); // Output: John
```

2. **Accessing the `age`:**

```javascript
let age = student.age;
console.log(age); // Output: 21
```

3. **Accessing the `city` in the `address` object:**

```javascript
let city = student.address.city;
console.log(city); // Output: Springfield
```

4. **Accessing the `courseName` of the first course:**

```javascript
let firstCourseName = student.courses[0].courseName;
console.log(firstCourseName); // Output: Introduction to Computer Science
```

5. **Accessing the `credits` of the second course:**

```javascript
let secondCourseCredits = student.courses[1].credits;
console.log(secondCourseCredits); // Output: 3
```

6. **Accessing the `isEnrolled` status:**

```javascript
let enrollmentStatus = student.isEnrolled;
console.log(enrollmentStatus); // Output: true
```

=== Advantages of JSON

Here are the key advantages of using JSON:

* **Lightweight and Simple**
JSON has a minimal and clean syntax that is easy to write and read. It uses fewer characters, which makes it lightweight for data exchange.

* **Human-Readable**
JSON is easy to read and understand for humans, even without prior knowledge of the structure.

* **Language-Independent**
JSON is supported by most programming languages, making it a versatile format for data exchange between systems written in different languages.

* **Easy to Parse**
JSON can be quickly parsed and converted into objects in most programming languages using built-in functions or libraries.

* **Structured Data Representation**
JSON allows for nested objects and arrays, which makes it flexible to represent complex data structures.

* **Widely Used in Web APIs**
JSON is the standard format for data exchange in RESTful web services, enabling seamless communication between clients and servers.

* **Efficient Data Transmission**
Due to its lightweight nature, JSON reduces the size of the data being transmitted, leading to faster data transfer and better performance in web applications.

These advantages make JSON a preferred format for data exchange in modern software applications, especially in web development and APIs.

=== API Anatomy

Here's the REST API anatomy in AsciiDoc format with *bold* for the headings:

*Base URL:*

The base URL is the root address for all the API endpoints.
Example: `https://api.example.com/v1`

*Endpoints:*

Endpoints are specific paths appended to the base URL to access resources.
Example: `/users`, `/products`, `/orders/12345`

*HTTP Methods:*

REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:

* *GET:* Retrieve a resource (e.g., `GET /users`)
* *POST:* Create a new resource (e.g., `POST /users`)
* *PUT:* Update an existing resource (e.g., `PUT /users/123`)
* *DELETE:* Delete a resource (e.g., `DELETE /users/123`)
* *PATCH:* Partially update a resource (e.g., `PATCH /users/123`)

*Headers:*

Headers carry additional metadata about the request or response:

* *Authorization:* Used for authentication (e.g., `Bearer token`)
* *Content-Type:* Specifies the format of the request body (e.g., `application/json`)
* *Accept:* Specifies the format the client expects in the response (e.g., `application/json`)

*Request Body:*

The request body is used in methods like POST, PUT, and PATCH to send data to the server.
Typically formatted in JSON:
```json
{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

*Response Body:*

The response body contains the data returned by the API, often in JSON format.
Example:
```json
{
    "userId": 123,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

*Status Codes:*

HTTP status codes indicate the result of the API request:
* *200 OK:* The request was successful.
* *201 Created:* A new resource was created (often in response to a POST request).
* *400 Bad Request:* The request was invalid or missing parameters.
* *401 Unauthorized:* Authentication failed or was not provided.
* *404 Not Found:* The requested resource does not exist.
* *500 Internal Server Error:* A generic server error occurred.

*Query Parameters:*

Query parameters are appended to the endpoint to filter or modify the data returned.
Example: `GET /users?age=25&location=NY`
Query parameters follow the `?` in the URL and are separated by `&`.

*Path Parameters:*

Path parameters are used to specify a particular resource within an endpoint.
Example: `GET /users/{userId}` â†’ `GET /users/123`

*Example REST API Request:*

*Request:*
`GET https://api.example.com/v1/users/123?include=address`

*Headers:*

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
```

*Response:*

```json
{
    "userId": 123,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Elm St",
        "city": "Springfield",
        "state": "IL",
        "postalCode": "62704"
    }
}
```

*Summary:*

The REST API anatomy consists of components like the base URL, endpoints, HTTP methods, headers, request/response bodies, status codes, query parameters, and path parameters. Together, they form a standardized way of interacting with resources in a RESTful manner.
