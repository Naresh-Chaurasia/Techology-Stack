== What are Web Services?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines how requests should be made, what data formats to use, and how responses should be handled. APIs enable different systems, applications, or services to communicate and share data seamlessly. In simpler terms, an API is like a bridge that connects different software components, allowing them to work together efficiently.

== Basics of REST API
- Definition of REST
- REST vs. SOAP

== Components of a RESTful Service
- Resources
- URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)


== HTTP Methods

  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE
  - PATCH

=== GET

The `GET` method is used to retrieve information from the server. It is a read-only operation and does not alter any data on the server.

[source, java]
----
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
----

Response:
[source, json]
----
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
----

=== POST

The `POST` method is used to create a new resource on the server. It sends data to the server to create a new entry.

[source, java]
----
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
}
----

Response:
[source, json]
----
{
    "id": 124,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane.smith@example.com"
}
----

=== PUT

The `PUT` method is used to update an existing resource on the server. It replaces the current representation of the resource with the new data.

[source, java]
----
PUT /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.new@example.com"
}
----

Response:
[source, json]
----
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.new@example.com"
}
----

=== DELETE

The `DELETE` method is used to delete a resource from the server.

[source, java]
----
DELETE /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
----

Response:
[source, json]
----
{
    "message": "User deleted successfully"
}
----

=== PATCH

The `PATCH` method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. It updates only the specified fields of the resource.

[source, java]
----
PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "email": "john.updated@example.com"
}
----

Response:
[source, json]
----
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.updated@example.com"
}
----

This overview provides a brief description and examples of how to use the common HTTP methods in RESTful web services to perform operations on resources.

== JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications, between a server and a client, or between different parts of an application.

*Key Features of JSON*

1. *Simplicity*: JSON's syntax is very simple and easy to understand. It uses key-value pairs and ordered lists to structure data.
2. *Language Independent*: Although JSON is derived from JavaScript, it is language-independent and can be used with many programming languages, including Python, Java, C#, PHP, and more.
3. *Text Format*: JSON is a plain text format, which makes it easy to transmit over a network and compatible with various data storage systems.

*JSON Structure*

JSON data is written as key-value pairs:

- *Objects*: Enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Objects contain key-value pairs.
- *Arrays*: Enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Arrays can contain multiple values.
- *Keys*: Strings enclosed in double quotes.
- *Values*: Can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, or `null`.

*Example*

Hereâ€™s a simple example of JSON data:

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zipCode": "12345"
    }
}
----

*Explanation*

- *"name"*: A string value.
- *"age"*: A number value.
- *"isStudent"*: A boolean value.
- *"courses"*: An array of strings.
- *"address"*: A nested object containing additional key-value pairs.

JSON is widely used in web APIs, configuration files, and data storage because of its simplicity and flexibility.

*JSON Examples*

Sure! Here are five JSON examples with increasing levels of complexity:

*Example 1: Simple JSON Object*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false
}
----

*Example 2: JSON Object with an Array*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "age": 25,
    "isStudent": true,
    "subjects": ["Math", "Science", "History"]
}
----

*Example 3: Nested JSON Object*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "age": 28,
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zipCode": "12345"
    },
    "isStudent": false
}
----

*Example 4: JSON Object with Nested Arrays and Objects*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Bob Brown",
    "age": 35,
    "address": {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Othertown",
        "zipCode": "67890"
    },
    "isStudent": false,
    "subjects": [
        {
            "name": "Math",
            "grade": "A"
        },
        {
            "name": "Science",
            "grade": "B"
        }
    ]
}
----


These examples progressively introduce more complexity by adding arrays, nested objects, and further levels of nesting.
