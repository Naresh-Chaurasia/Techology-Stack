===  **Project: Library Management System**

**Objective**:

Develop a database system to manage books, members, and borrow records for a library.

**Key Features**:

- Designing and Creating Database Tables (Books, Members, Borrow Records)
- Implementing CRUD Operations for Book and Member Management
- Tracking Book Borrowing and Return Dates
- Using Joins and Aggregate Functions to Generate Reports (e.g., Most Borrowed Books, Active Members)
- Creating Views for Simplified Data Access
- Implementing Stored Procedures for Automated Updates (e.g., overdue notices)
