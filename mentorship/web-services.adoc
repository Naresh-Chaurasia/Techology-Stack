== What are Web Services?

- Types of Web Services

== Basics of REST API
- Definition of REST
- REST vs. SOAP

== Components of a RESTful Service
- Resources
- URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
- HTTP Methods
  - GET
  - POST
  - PUT
  - DELETE
  - PATCH
- Status Codes
  - 1xx (Informational)
  - 2xx (Success)
  - 3xx (Redirection)
  - 4xx (Client Error)
  - 5xx (Server Error)

== Consuming RESTful APIs
- Tools for Testing APIs (Postman, curl)
- Making Requests (with Python, JavaScript)
- Parsing Responses

== Error Handling
- Client-Side Errors
- Server-Side Errors
- Error Messages and Codes


== Practical Examples
- Building a Simple REST API with Flask (Python)
- Building a Simple REST API with Express (JavaScript/Node.js)

== JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications, between a server and a client, or between different parts of an application.

*Key Features of JSON*

1. *Simplicity*: JSON's syntax is very simple and easy to understand. It uses key-value pairs and ordered lists to structure data.
2. *Language Independent*: Although JSON is derived from JavaScript, it is language-independent and can be used with many programming languages, including Python, Java, C#, PHP, and more.
3. *Text Format*: JSON is a plain text format, which makes it easy to transmit over a network and compatible with various data storage systems.

*JSON Structure*

JSON data is written as key-value pairs:

- *Objects*: Enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Objects contain key-value pairs.
- *Arrays*: Enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Arrays can contain multiple values.
- *Keys*: Strings enclosed in double quotes.
- *Values*: Can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, or `null`.

*Example*

Hereâ€™s a simple example of JSON data:

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science", "History"],
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zipCode": "12345"
    }
}
----

*Explanation*

- *"name"*: A string value.
- *"age"*: A number value.
- *"isStudent"*: A boolean value.
- *"courses"*: An array of strings.
- *"address"*: A nested object containing additional key-value pairs.

JSON is widely used in web APIs, configuration files, and data storage because of its simplicity and flexibility.

*JSON Examples*

Sure! Here are five JSON examples with increasing levels of complexity:

*Example 1: Simple JSON Object*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false
}
----

*Example 2: JSON Object with an Array*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "age": 25,
    "isStudent": true,
    "subjects": ["Math", "Science", "History"]
}
----

*Example 3: Nested JSON Object*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "age": 28,
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zipCode": "12345"
    },
    "isStudent": false
}
----

*Example 4: JSON Object with Nested Arrays and Objects*

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Bob Brown",
    "age": 35,
    "address": {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Othertown",
        "zipCode": "67890"
    },
    "isStudent": false,
    "subjects": [
        {
            "name": "Math",
            "grade": "A"
        },
        {
            "name": "Science",
            "grade": "B"
        }
    ]
}
----


These examples progressively introduce more complexity by adding arrays, nested objects, and further levels of nesting.
