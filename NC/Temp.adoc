Debugging is an essential skill for every Java developer. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides a powerful and intuitive environment for debugging Java applications. This guide covers the basics of setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and stepping through your code in VS Code.

*Setting Up Your Environment*

Before you start debugging, ensure that:
1. You have the **Java Extension Pack** installed in VS Code.
2. Your project is properly set up with a `launch.json` file, which tells VS Code how to run and debug your application.

*How to Debug a Java Program in VS Code

*Step 1: Set Breakpoints*

Breakpoints are points in your code where the debugger will pause execution. You can set breakpoints by:
1. Clicking on the left margin next to the line number in your source code.
2. Pressing `F9` when your cursor is on the desired line.

*Step 2: Start Debugging*

To start debugging:
1. Open the file you want to debug.
2. Press `F5` to launch the debugger or click on the "Run and Debug" button in the left sidebar.
3. The debugger will start, and execution will pause at your breakpoints.

*Step 3: Inspect Variables and Step Through Code*

When your program hits a breakpoint:
- You can inspect variables by hovering over them or using the "Variables" pane.
- Use the following commands to control the debugger:
  * `F10`: Step over a line of code.
  * `F11`: Step into a method.
  * `Shift+F11`: Step out of a method.
  * `F5`: Continue execution.

*Example 1: Debugging a Simple Java Program*

[source,java]
----
public class DebugExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;
        int result = add(a, b);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public static int add(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
----

In this example:
- Set a breakpoint on the line `int result = add(a, b);`.
- Start the debugger (`F5`), and observe how execution pauses at the breakpoint.
- Use `F11` to step into the `add` method and inspect the variables `num1` and `num2`.

*Example 2: Handling Conditional Breakpoints*

Sometimes, you only want the debugger to pause when a certain condition is met. You can set a conditional breakpoint by:
1. Right-clicking on an existing breakpoint.
2. Selecting "Edit Breakpoint" and entering the condition (e.g., `a > 5`).

Let's modify the earlier code:

[source,java]
----
public class ConditionalDebug {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int result = multiply(i, 2);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        }
    }

    public static int multiply(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 * num2;
    }
}
----

In this example:
- Set a breakpoint on the line `int result = multiply(i, 2);`.
- Edit the breakpoint and add a condition: `i > 5`.
- The debugger will now only pause when the loop variable `i` is greater than 5.

*Conclusion*

Debugging in Visual Studio Code is straightforward and highly effective for Java development. By mastering breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables, youâ€™ll be able to identify and fix issues in your code more efficiently.
